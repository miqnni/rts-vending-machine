## Description

This project is an AADL (Architecture Analysis & Design Language) model of a vending machine with hot and cold beverages. The system consists of multiple interconnected components - both hardware and software - enabling users to make payments in cash (coins and notes) or by credit card and select drinks that will be automatically prepared.

## System functionalities

-   Preparing hot coffee (along with grinding coffee beans)
-   Preparing hot tea out of fresh leaves
-   Refrigerating, preparing and dispensing cold drinks
-   Processing and integrating payment in cash (coins + notes / bills) and by credit card.
-   Allowing the user to intuitively select their drinks using an interactive touch panel.
-   Storing different beverage recipes in the machine's memory.
-   Automatic cup dispensing and lifting, so that the user does not have to do anything while their drink is being prepared.
