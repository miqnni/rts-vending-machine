## Description

This project is an AADL (Architecture Analysis & Design Language) model of a vending machine with hot and cold beverages. The system consists of multiple interconnected components - both hardware and software - enabling users to make payments in cash (coins and notes) or by credit card and select drinks that will be automatically prepared.

## System functionalities

- Preparing hot coffee (along with grinding coffee beans)
- Preparing hot tea out of fresh leaves
- Refrigerating, preparing and dispensing cold drinks
- Processing and integrating payment in cash (coins + notes / bills) and by credit card.
- Allowing the user to intuitively select their drinks using an interactive touch panel.
- Storing different beverage recipes in the machine's memory.
- Automatic cup dispensing and lifting, so that the user does not have to do anything while their drink is being prepared.

## AADL Components

### Data

- `TemperatureType` - Represents the value of temperature in the unit used in the model's implementation, e.g. Celsius degrees, Fahrenheit degrees, Kelvins.
- `HeaterControlType` - Contains the information on whether the heater is turned on or off. Applies to the preparation of hot beverages.
- `CoolerControlType` - Contains the information on whether the cooler is turned on or off. Applies to the preparation of cold beverages.
- `TeaLeavesAmount` - Contains the information of the amount of tea leaves that can be used for tea preparation. The unit is dependent on the implementation of the model (e.g. grams, kilograms, pounds).

### Devices

- `TempSensor` Checks the current temperature in a particular spot. May be applied to liquids that are subject to heating or cooling, such as water and milk.
- `Heater` - Is responsible for heating the liquid beverage ingredients, e.g. water.
- `Refrigerator` - AKA Cooler. Is responsible for cooling the liquid beverage ingredients, e.g. water.
- `TeaLeavesDispenser` - Is responsible for dispensing a designated amount of tea leaves (`TeaLeavesAmount`), that will be used for tea preparation.
- `TeaCooker` - Combines leaves (`LeavesIn`) and water (`WaterWaterIn`) to produce **hot** liquid tea (`TeaOut`).
- `CoffeeBeansStorage` - Stores (and passes to the grinder) a certain amount of coffee beans (`BeansOut`).
- `CoffeeGrinder` - Converts a designated amount of coffee beans (`BeansIn`) to a certain amount of ground coffee (`GroundOut`).
- `CoffeeBrewer` - Converts ground coffee (`GroundCoffee`) into **hot** liquid coffee (`LiquidCoffee`).
- `RecipeStorage` - Stores recipes for various beverages that can be prepared by the machine on user's command. The user selects the recipe using the machine's touchable panel (`TouchEvent`), which results in returning the details of preparation of the selected beverage (`RecipeOut`).
- `CupDispenser` - Upon receiving a start signal (`StartSignal`), dispenses a cup and returns a finish signal (`FinishSignal`).
- `CupLifter` - Upon receiving a start signal (`StartSignal`), lifts a cup and returns a finish signal (`FinishSignal`).
- `CoinMechanism` - Upon receiving a coin insertion signal (`CoinSignal`), determines the value (`CoinValue`) of the inserted coin.
- `BillAcceptor` - Upon receiving a note / bill insertion signal (`BillSignal`), determines the value (`BillValue`) of the inserted note / bill.
- `CardScanner` - Upon receiving a credit card insertion signal (`CardSignal`), returns the result of the card authentication (`CardAuthSignal`).
- `TouchablePanel` - Gets the current value of the input on the touchable panel (`TouchInput`).

### Threads

- `GetRecipe` - Based on the input on touch panel (`TouchInput`), returns a particular recipe (`RecipeInfo`). Gets executed every `1600ms` and the execution time ranges from `0ms` to `1ms`.
- `SelectIngredient` - Takes a recipe (`Recipe`), returns ingredients (`IngredientOut`) for that recipe (similarly to the `IngredientSelector` device, but with specified execution interval and duration).
- `SelectTemperature` - Takes a recipe (`RecipeIn`) and returns the temperature (`TemperatureOut`) of the liquid used in that recipe.
- `CheckAvailability` - Takes an ingredient (`IngredientInfo`) and tells whether it is available (`IsAvailable`) to be used in the preparation of the selected beverage.
- `DispenseCup` - Upon receiving a start signal (`StartSignal`), dispenses a cup and returns a finish signal (`FinishSignal`).
- `LiftCup` - Upon receiving a start signal (`StartSignal`), lifts a cup and returns a finish signal (`FinishSignal`).

- `MoneyCounterThread` - Sums the total values of coins and bills.
- `ResolvePaymentAttempt` - Thread for additional payment integration. This thread will be responsible for:
	- summing the value of coins and notes;
	- checking whether card payment was authorized;
	- setting `ReadyOut` to `true` should the user pay enough money.
- `ReturnChange` - Based on the beverage price (`NeededValueIn`) and actual amount of money paid (`PaidValueIn`), determines the change to be returned (`ChangeValueOut`).
- `InterpretUserAction` - Take an input (`TouchInput`) from the touch panel and interpret it as a command (`UserCommand`).
- `ReadTemperature` - Reads the temperature (`TempIn`) from a designated sensor (device) and returns its value (`TempOut`).
- `ToggleHeater` - If the temperature (`Temp`) of the liquid is too low for the currently prepared beverage, turn on (`HeaterCmd`) the heater. Otherwise, turn it off.
- `HeaterDriver` - A driver for the heater. Supports powering the heater on and off.
- `ToggleCooler` - If the temperature (`Temp`) of the liquid is too high for the currently prepared beverage, turn on (`HeaterCmd`) the refrigerator. Otherwise, turn it off.
- `RefrigerationDriver` - A driver for the refrigerator. Supports powering the refrigerator on and off.
- `PrepareTea` - On the start signal (`StartSignal`), return the proper amount of tea (`TeaPoured`).
- `PrepareCoffee` - On the start signal (`StartSignal`), return the proper amount of coffee (`CoffeePoured`).
- `MainController` - The thread that represents the full logic / flow of the exemplary use case of the vending machine:
	- Recipe choice by user.
	- Checking ingredient availability.
	- Checking if the proper amount of liquid (water or milk) is available.
	- Making a payment.
	- Dispensing and lifting the cup
	- Dispensing necessary ingredients: tea leaves or coffee beans..
	- Adjusting the liquid (water or milk) temperature.
